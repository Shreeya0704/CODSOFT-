Crafting a to-do list with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript involves a powerful trio. HTML structures the foundation, CSS adds visual flair, and JavaScript brings interactivity. Users enter tasks through an HTML form, with JavaScript capturing that input and dynamically adding it to the list. CSS styles the elements, making the list visually appealing. JavaScript also empowers users to check off completed tasks, potentially with a strikethrough effect in CSS, and even delete items they no longer need. This interplay creates a functional and user-friendly to-do list application. Thanks to CODSOFT for this opportunity to delve into web development!
